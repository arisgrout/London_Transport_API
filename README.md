# The Amazing Race - London Edition
## Objective

Use the [Transport of London](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/) API to plan an Amazing Race - London edition.

## Approach
1. Use the Python *requests module* to pull data from a REST-API.
2. Explore JSON files using IPython.display
3. Present plan for the Amazing Race London!

*This project was done for fun! My presentation showcases my conclusions in a humorous but meaningful way. The "Amazing Race" twist was a personal decision, to entertain myself and turn this work booklet into a business savy exercise. Enjoy! :)*
